    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Vani</strong>. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Vani and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Vani app does not require users to register or provide any personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or phone number) to use its core features. We aim to provide a safe and anonymous experience for all devotees.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services & Advertisements</h2>
    <p>To keep our service free, we use third-party tools that may collect information used to identify you. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for app functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used for displaying advertisements. AdMob may use your device's Advertising ID to show personalized ads based on your interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Log Data & Cookies</h2>
    <p>In case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This app does not use “cookies” explicitly. However, third-party code and libraries (like AdMob) may use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Vani is a family-oriented app, especially popular during Saraswati Puja for the "Hate-Khori" (Digital Slate) ritual.

If you think your child provided this kind of information on our app, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
